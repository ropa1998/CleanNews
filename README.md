# CleanNews

This implementation is a first version of CleanNews, a service that allows users to cross Twitter trends of a specific region against all articles of various desired news outlets.

For scrapping information (either from Twitter or from different outlets) I used [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/)

To show the information in a stylish way I used [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

## How to Use
Honestly, this project was not designed to be reused. Most variables that modify behavior cannot be passed as arguments. In order to adapt it for your intended use you should modify the code.

Still some of the code could be useful and reused. I hope you find it useful.
